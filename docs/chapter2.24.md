# Architecting for the cloud best practices - Part 1
## Traditional computing vs Cloud computing
- It Assets as provisioned resources
- Global, Available and scaleable capacity
- Higher level managed services
- Built in security
- Architecting for cost
- Operation on AWS
### Scalability
- Scale up
- Scale out
    - Stateless Applications
    - Distribute load to multiples nodes
    - stateless components
    - Stateful components
    - Implement Session Affinity
    - Distributed processing
    - Implement Distributed Processing

## Disposable resources insted of fixed server
### Instantiating compute resources
- Bootstrapping
- Golden images
- Containers
- Hybrid

### Infrastructures as code
- Cloudformation

## Automation
### Serverles Management and Deployment

### Infrastructure managemenet and deployment
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Aws Systems Manager
- AutoScaling

### Alarms and events
- Amazon Cloudwatch alarms
- Amazon Cloudwatch events
- Aws Lambda scheduled events
- AWS WAF security atomations

## Loose Coupling

### Well defined Interfaces
- Amazon API Gateway

### Service Discovery
- Implement services discovery

### Asyncronous integration

### Distributed systems best practices
- Gracefull Failure in practice

## Services Not Servers
- Managed services
- Serverless Architectures
